# Patryk Adamczyk Alf Public Configuration
## What is this ?
This is my configuration for aliases in bash using alf (related links you can find in alf-conf/README.md).
I additionally started to switch from bash to PowerShell because of PowerShell being cross-platform and easier to understand than bash for me.
## Why ?
Initially my alf-conf was private because alf have option to easily save changes to configuration in git repository so to not have possibility to leak something I made it private.
But I like concept of public dotfiles, so before I find good way to manage dotfiles for me. I will make public my aliases which is main part of my setup anyway.
## Folder Structure
- `./alf-conf` - My configuration of alf for bash aliases
- `./Bash` - bash_aliases made by alf from alf-conf
- `./PowerShell` - my port of alf and additional aliases,functions etc. for PowerShell
